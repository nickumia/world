      There is sooo much to learn about how to understand and manage finances.
      You will not find concepts or information about specific assets.  You will
      not find catchy phrases about stocks, real estate, cryptocurrencies or anything
      else like that.<br/><br/>
      You WILL find a method for evaluating whether you should explore a new asset
      class.  This method will help to frame how you can understand the asset and
      what the asset will do for you.  The hope is that you will be able to explore
      and learn in more deliberate way.

        unexpected events over the rest of his life. With a high net worth, there is
        flexibility (and possibly freedom). With a low net worth, this is a bit dangerous.

        classes to earn the same level of income through other means. He has the
        freedom to explore without needing to constantly be looking for more. If
        Nick's net worth is high enough, it can be used to generate income.

        If Nick lives below his means, he has freedom to not spend as much attention to
        his income activities. There is safety in knowing that his income can face some
        interruption and he'll be able to satisfy ends meet. If he wants to save money

      A lot of financial advice tends to ask people to re-evaluate their entire

      fair to give blanket advice for "common" situations.  Everyone should
      definitely introspect on whether they are doing what they want to.  However,
      if someone is looking to have a certain lifestyle, they should be able to
      work towards it.  Depending on the gravity of a person's situation some
      harsh sacrifices may help to more rapidly align their reality to their goals.

      Finding and/or building a financial circle that supports your goals,

      What makes money valuable?
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" marked="center" align="center" component="p" style={{paddingTop: "2%"}}>
      The value of money lies in what is important to us.  I'm in the minority
      in saying that I think money is garbage and I hate the idea of how money
      exists in the world today (as well as during most of the history of the
      world).  The secret sauce of the universe.. Our connection to Bhagavan
      (God).. Life.. Love.. Whatever is fundamental to all of these different views
      is what I think is the only valuable thing that exists. <br/><br/>
      Money is a tool.. a utility.. a technology that attempts to "standardize" value
      to be something that we can exchange.  I agree that this ability is important.
      It's just been poorly implemented and maliciously warped and abused. 😮‍💨
      😅  Let me chill on the deep philosophy for now though haha..<br/><br/>
      To draw on an idea that I heard from Trevor Noah,<br/><br/>
      <i>money gives us access</i><br/><br/>
      I'll re-define the way that he meant it.  Money gives us access to the
      things that we value most.  Some of us value things that aren't valued
      effectively through money and so, we don't need as much money.  What
      makes all of this more difficult is the way that the "<i>standard of living</i>"
      has evolved in the world and the cost of achieving the ever increasing
      standard of living.<br/><br/>
      My advice to you... <b>figure out what you value and then understand how money
      works for you to represent that value</b>.  I value people and energy.
      Money is not particularly equipped to work for me.  I use money to help
      people I can and I use it to free up my energy to be able to support the
      the people I care about.  I have aspirations about things that would be
      nice-to-have; but my primary focus is to become financially independent so
      that I can free myself up to take care of my family and loved ones and to
      work on projects to build the foundations of a people-first technological
      future.<br/><br/>
      Find your value.  Find what you value.  Work towards understanding money
      as it relates to those things.

      Time vs. Energy
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" marked="center" align="center" component="p" style={{paddingTop: "2%"}}>
      Another unpopular belief I have is that Energy is way more important than Time.
      I'm not actually trying to argue one way or another.  Time resonates as a
      core resource for many people.  All I will say is that time is a byproduct
      of life.  Regardless of what happens, time will move forward.  Time cannot
      be optimized.  It cannot be controlled or influenced in any meaningful way.
      If technology evolves where time travel is possible and time becomes an
      infinite resource...  Or if health advancements are made and we live healthier
      longer, we'll have more of it.  If bio-tech advancements are made and we're
      able to access more of our brain capacity or our physical capacity, the story
      of time will surely be different ...<br/><br/>
      My point lies in each of these sentences.  What do we have access to that
      makes time valuable?  <i>Energy.</i><br/><br/>
      With the right energy, motivation, inspiration ... and willpower levels, we can
      actually make the most of time.  If we work too hard, we'll burn out and
      waste time.  If we laze around too much, we'll waste time.  The only limit
      to energy is the limit that we think we have.  Energy takes on so many forms.
      Physical.  Emotional.  Mental.  Electricity.  Solar.  Hydro, Wind, Nuclear.
      Spiritual.  Internal.  External.  Potential.  Kinetic. ... <br/><br/>
      By all means, use your time effectively. <br/><br/>
      One of my favorite things to talk about on this topic is the issue of being
      "paid for time" vs. "paid for energy".  Whether salaried or hourly, we are
      compensated for our time at work.  But there is no direct correlation from <i>
      time spent</i> to <i>results achieved</i>.  We've all been on teams where
      we see the disparity between a highly-motivated person and the average or
      below average person.  Both can have the same position, the same salary,
      for all intents and purposes, the same compensation and they can and do
      deliver different results.  Instead of a "minimum wage", I think people
      would appreciate getting paid for the effort they give.  I <i>"think"</i> the
      idea is if a person <i>"works harder"</i> and gives more energy per time
      unit, they <i>"will"</i> be valued and <i>"promoted"</i>.  But the equation is
      fundamentally broken.  Why would a person give more of something that they
      are not being paid for? <br/><br/>
      One caveat to the "paid for time" vs. "paid for energy" conversation is older
      more repetitive, mechanic, robotic type jobs where it was about completing a
      set limit of work a day (based on limitations of the human body).  Factory
      work, assembly lines and such were prime  candidates.  I think people are
      realizing that those jobs were just compensating for incomplete autonomous
      robotic systems.  As technology continues to evolve, there are very few jobs
      that can't be automated.  Mentally demanding jobs highlight the issue of time
      vs. energy best, e.g.  a software engineer needing to debug software...  a doctor
      needing to remember knowledge and information in high pressure environments...
      an architect creatively solving design challenges...  there are sooo many more..
      but I'll leave you with that for now. <br/><br/>
      This is not to say that time is not important.  It's super important to
      understand the effect that time has on things.  Just to be clear, life happens,
      which has time as an attribute or an effect.  This attribute can be a great
      reference to view other things.  Time doesn't directly influence anything.
      It is still a byproduct.<br/><br/>
      The most common thing to hear about is the <i>time-value of money</i>.  Money
      today is worth more than money in the future.  This is not because time
      creates value for money.  Psychologically, you can't use something that you
      don't have right now.  To compensate for "lost" time in the past, people
      expect money to have more value in the future.  If future money is worth
      the same or less value in the future, it's seen as a loss.  There is
      the world of accounting and finance math that was created to quantify this
      subjective view.  But at the end of the day, the value that money has is
      whatever someone else is willing to give you for it.

      Ups and Downs..  Positive and Negative.. Gains and Loss.. The Pendulum of Finance
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" marked="center" align="center" component="p" style={{paddingTop: "2%"}}>
      All of finance is essentially classified in three ways:<br/>
      (1) There's a surplus of money (a gain)<br/>
      (2) There's a deficit of money (a loss)<br/>
      (3) There's the same amount of money (neutral)<br/><br/>

      Investment gains.. Savings interst.. Dividends.. Income.. Royalties..
      Asset Appreciation.. Taxes.. are all conditions where there's MORE money
      on your side.<br/><br/>
      Investment losses.. Debt payments.. Expenses.. Loss of principal..
      Asset Depreciation.. are all conditions where there's LESS money on your
      side.<br/><br/>
      Anything that's essentially free presents the case where there's the same
      amount of money.. along with the case when there's a zero interest rate.<br/><br/>
      Even in the simplest case, most people have soo many things that either go
      up or down in financial value, it's hard to keep it all in perspective.
      In the <i>Net Worth</i> mindset, assets and liabilities that either
      appreciate or depreciate in value are usually cornerstones of tracking finances.
      In the <i>Income</i> mindset, revenue and expenses that represent the inflow
      or outflow of money are the comparable cornerstones of finances.<br/><br/>
      The concept is simple, but the ways in which it manifests are almost innumerable.
      It gets exceedingly complicated when there are multiple people involved,
      such as a supply chain, or when time in involved, such as a series of
      transactions or a history of owners.  When learning about a financial
      concept or product, the simplest way to understand it is by decomposing it
      into its gain, loss or neutral components.<br/><br/>
      Let's take a savings account as an example.  Money deposited into a savings
      account earns interest, a gain.  The account charges fees, a loss.  The interest
      earned is taxed, a loss.  The original principle is insured by the FDIC and
      remains constant, a neutral component.  There's two other aspects, being
      contributions and withdrawals, that effect the math.  While it is a bit
      unconventional, contributions increase the value of the account and can be
      viewed from the perspective of being a "gain".  Similarly, a withdrawal is a
      decrease in value and can be viewed as a "loss".  It is NOT gain/loss in the
      traditional sense, but these activiies have a positive (contribution) or
      negative (withdrawal) effect on the total value.  Viewing it from this lens
      helps to qualify the activities in general.
      Tangentially related to the last statement, transfers are an example of
      having the same amount of money, having a neutral or net-zero change.  There
      is a change, but it doesn't effect the big picture.  Another term for this is
      reallocation (i.e. moving money around).<br/><br/>
      Having a clear picture of these three concepts provides a solid foundation for
      learning more advanced financial concepts.

      Risk Management

    <Typography variant="body1" marked="center" align="center" component="p" style={{paddingTop: "2%"}}>
      Risk is the possibility of a loss.  At face value, Risk might sound like only
      a financial loss. For all intents and purposes, a loss is almost entirely
      tied to a monetary value.  But risk is not just in the financial aspect.  A
      risk puts the value that money represents at stake.  By understanding the true
      value of money.. understanding your value of money.. risk can be better managed.
      This is why understanding what value money has is so important.  In the most
      general sense, <b>risk is the potential loss of access to the things you value.</b>

      Everyone has a different risk tolerance.  Even risky people are conservative
      (or want to do everything in their power) to protect the things they value.
      Conservative people may be risky in ways they don't realize.  Life is defined
      by changes.  Change is, by definition, risky because it can always go either
      way.  Being able to handle unexpected changes is one way of looking at the
      problem of risk.  What are you willing to lose and when?

      There is no golden ticket for managing risk.  It's a very personal choice and
      it's very dependent on the circumstances.  I'm both an adventurous and risky
      person.  I love doing spontaneous things to make the most of moments.  Many
      people judge me for my picky appetite which is not at all adventurous and is
      not open to change.  This is only to highlight the ways in which a person's
      risk tolerance may differ.  If I was truly adventurous, some might argue that
      I should love to try new foods too.  As it relates to our discussion,
      a person may take on more risk in stocks; but they really don't think the risk
      of cryptocurrencies is worth it.  It's important to understand why certain
      risks are acceptable and others are not.  This will help evaluate the
      advantages and disadvantages of not taking on that risk.

      Money is an extension of who a person is.  If someone doesn't know themselves,
      it's hard to manage and use money effectively.  There's still a lot to learn;
      but this at least acts as one of many filters for what needs to be learned and
      to what extent it needs to be learned.  To remember some of the concepts
      mentioned above, ask yourself these questions:<br/><br/>
      What does money give me access to?  What do I want to do with it?<br/>
      Can I use it when I need it for what I need it for?<br/>
      Is it safe?  Will it be what I expect it to be when I use it?  Will it
      lose value?<br/>
      Can it grow so that I can free up mental and physical pressure?  Does it
      need to grow?<br/>
      Are there any taxes owed on the money?  Or will there be taxes imposed when
      using it in the future?
