    Before reading this, I recommend reading
    <a href="/inhibition">Inhibition</a> as some logic to understand
    some of the inhibition I describe here.

<p>
    Growing up, I learned a lot without actually knowing what I was
    learning.  Looking back, I lived most of my life <i>finding myself</i>.
    There's a part of me now that's about <i>making myself</i>. The
    unspoken rules were clear: excel at everything, never show
    weakness, and above all, don't fail. I became an expert at
    <i>playing the part</i>...the straight-A student, the overachiever,
    the one who always had it together.  But beneath the surface,
    I was drowning in the weight of expectations, both real and
    imagined.
</p>
<p>
    During the road trip, I found a new way of hearing my own voice.
    I had started taking more risks for a few years prior, but the
    road trip gave me the opportunity to do it in a whole new way.
    Out there was the new frontier;  I said yes to conversations,
    to risk connection, to let <b>curiosity pull me forward instead of
    inhibition pulling me back</b>.  <i>(There were loads of times
    when inhibition pulled me back; times when I didn't take the
    risks because I had tied myself to a schedule about "getting
    back to a life" that I knew I "had to" get back to.  We'll
    revisit this in a future post.)</i>
</p>

<p>
    And it worked.
</p>
<p>
    The more I opened to the world, the more the world opened to me.
    I wasn't perfect; just willing.
    Baby steps, but real steps.
</p>

<p>
    But when I came home, something strange happened.
</p>

<p>
    All that growth...
</p>
<p>
    All that openness...
</p>
<p>
    All the new ways I learned to communicate...
</p>
<p>
    It felt like they slipped away...
</p>
<p>
    I could talk with strangers.
    I could talk with people I'd met for five minutes.
    But with people I've known my whole life?
</p>
<p>
    My voice felt like it got swallowed by gravity.  How could I
    talk about all of the things I'd learned on the road?  The things
    that had changed me.  The things that weren't as tangible for
    others as they were for me.
</p>
<p>
    Not because they're bad or unloving.
    But because the roles, the patterns, the emotional habits we
    built decades ago don't update just because I did.
</p>
<p>
    Family systems are like old software; stable, predictable,
    familiar.  But not easily re-written.
</p>

<p>
    And for the first time, I had language for something I've
    struggled with for years:
</p>

<p>
    Why does it feel so hard to speak freely with people I love,
    even when I can speak effortlessly everywhere else?
</p>

<p>
    On the road, I stretched.
    At home, I collapsed back into older versions of myself.
</p>

<p>
    I realized that growth doesn't guarantee recognition.
    Sometimes the world outside evolves with you,
    and the world inside stays exactly the same.
</p>

<p>
    And that's okay.  This isn't a complaint.
    Just honesty.
</p>

<p>
    I don't need my family to change for me to keep growing.
    I don't need every environment to reflect who I am now.
</p>
<p>
    But I am learning to separate "being unchanged" from the
    feeling of being blocked.
</p>

<p>
    I've changed.
</p>
<p>
    The road changed me.
</p>
<p>
    The risks changed me.
</p>
<p>
    The conversations with strangers changed me.
</p>
<p>
    But certain environments don't evolve just because you do;
    and realizing that took a weight off my shoulders I didn't
    know I was carrying.
