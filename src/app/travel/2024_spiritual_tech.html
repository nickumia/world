<p>This page will be home to the updates relating to my road trip across America, coined as Spiritual
Tech.  It's important to understand the meaning behind the naming.  I'm defining <i>spiritual</i> as
anything that is not physical and my goal is to use technology to connect this spiritual elements to
create a better tomorrow.  I can't do it alone and I wouldn't want to if I could.  As much freedom as
there is in doing stuff by yourself, it's way more fun to do it with great company.<p>

<p>For now, check out the trailers for my trip to get a feel for what it'll be like.  If you like it,
please reach out and let's make some great stuff happen together!</p>
