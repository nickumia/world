<p>Vietnam was never on my horizon.  I had known about the Philippines and Japan and Singapore.
All of them being on my list of places to visit.  I used to see travel vlogs talking about Thailand,
Bali (and maybe Vietnam was in there somewhere).  But I never had any ambition to go anywhere
specifically.  With my deep roots in India, Asia is closely tied to me.. I always had an attraction to
general Asian things, but it's hard to pinpoint how or when it all started.  I had decided to do the
US Road Trip, and somewhere in its development, my travel appetite opened up.</p>

<p>The origins of the Vietnam trip are hidden away in the close ties that were formed during my stop
in SLC, UT.  A fateful encounter with a pair of Airbnb hosts in the brisk snow-filled beginning of
November 2024.  In passing conversations, I was invited to join my new friends in their travels to
Vietnam and somehow, through all the chaos of life, we made it happen!</p>

<p>All I had known about Vietnam was split between my world history knowledge (i.e. the Vietnam War)
from high school as well as some random Vietnamese friends I had made thus far in life.  Being an
unknown place and unknown language, I had reservations.  Specifically, if I wasn't going with
someone who spoke the language, I would not have made the trip.</p>

<p>The flight there turned out to be it's own mini-adventure.  As I was pausing my US Road Trip in
Syracuse, NY, I had connecting flights from SYR-DEN-NRT-SGN split across 30 hours.  My main layover
was 5 hours in Tokyo.  I made a friend there and had (lunch? dinner?) with him.  Ironically, we were
both traveling to SE Asia, but we were going to be in Vietnam at different times.  It was soo close,
it was pretty cool.</p>

<p>I had landed around 11:10pm local time in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>

<p>By the time I got through customs, met up with my friends and we made it to the first of 4 Airbnbs,
it was around 01:00am.  We explored the local area a bit, got a late night bite to eat and it was
probably around 03:00am when we debated going to sleep, or just staying up.  I think I got about 2
hours of sleep that night.  But it is soooo weird... like.. I woke up feeling like I had caught up
on the sleep I missed from all of my life up until then.  It was soo strange.  I believe there is
some positive energy in that area where we were because every night in Ho Chi Minh was an amazing
night sleep for me and I don't normally have any opinions about sleep whatsoever.</p>

<p>There is so much that happened during the trip that I can't possibly blog about it all.  I
had made these videos as a replacement for blogging, so definitely watch them and then we can talk
about some of my takeaways from the visit,</p>

<p>The biggest thing that surprised me was how well I adapted to the culture.  With a little bit of
English and even without relying on google translate, I was able to move around and do everything
I needed to while I was alone.  There were a decent amount of body gestures and such, but not much
more than I normally do.  It felt really nice to connect with people there.  My friends were surprised
at how often I wandered off on my own.</p>

<p>There is this one encounter, specifically the second morning I was in Ho Chi Minh.  The Airbnb was
a little strange and somehow we had run out of water (it wasn't clear if it was just hot water or
all water or if the water distribution system was not working).  But I couldn't start the day without
showering.. that's just how I am.  "Exploring" a little, there was a old school shower setup on the roof.
I'm only familiar with it because of my Indian knowledge.  Like sitting on a stool with a bucket of water,
where there are clothelines and such.</p>

<p>I was getting ready to shower.. in my underwear.. on the roof haha.. And behind a mesh metal fence, the
neighbors, an old married couple, appeared.  I was going to wait until they left, but then I made eye
contact and the old man struck up a conversation.  I don't remember exactly how it started, but we ended
up talking about our histories a bit, obviously the water situation and some other things.  But just that
encounter was so heartwarming and is definitely one of my more precious memories in life.  It's precious
as a solo experience memory, not to be compared with precious memories with close friends and family.
It's different when you are alone and have encounters like those.  I took a video of me eventually
showering there, but I had decided not to include it in the series.  (P.S. TMI I've never seen this, so I
don't know what people do, but I did take my underwear off to wash the rest of me, so there was a minute
where I was completely naked on a roof haha ðŸ˜…)</p>

<p>There are many more moments like that.  Off camera.  That is impossible to capture.  And there's a
specific energy surrounding moments like those that make life feel fulfilling.  It feels as though things
make sense.  It feels as though you are where you're meant to be.  That is a feeling I've gotten many
glimpses of on my road trip, and am still trying to make sense of.  It's a bit of deja vu, but with a
different twist of familiarity.</p>

<p>If I had to summarize the trip, the country, and compare it to my experience in America, it is
really not that different.  A lot of the conveniences we have here in America also exist in Vietnam.
Sure, the government is different, but practically, lifestyles are not super affected by the government.
The entire fabric of how society operates is completely different.  But still the daily tasks people do,
the encounters people have, are not that different.  It's hard to tell what is American influence vs.
how much life would actually be the same, even if America wasn't in the picture.</p>

<p>There are a ton of nuances, just like with any country or culture.  The Vietnam War and its effects
on the people are real.  Just like slavery in America.  It's such a complex issue, a single blog post
can't possibly acknowledge the depth of the situation.</p>

<p>Personally, it was an amazing trip and I am so honored to have gotten the opportunity to travel there.
I don't currently have a "need" to go back.  But I believe most people, specifically most Americans,
should visit it at least once in their life.  For all of the change that America has made on the world,
I think Americans should go and see how our country is actually affecting the world.</p>

<p>I've gotten a lot of experience and it's hard to just dump it all at once.  If I have time to revisit,
I will come back and share more of my experiences in Vietnam.  Who knows, I may even make it back there
when I do my next trip to SE Asia.  I've definitely fallen in love with aspects of SE Asian culture and
it's specifically made me want to prioritize my trip to Japan.  I told myself that I'll just spend six
months and go through all of SE Asia all at once, but that may or may not happen depending on how the
rest of my life goes.</p>
