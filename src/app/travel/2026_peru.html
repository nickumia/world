Well.. haha.. This is kind of awkward 😅  Who would've thought that I'd make it to Peru?
During New Years, I bought some new HP-themed journaling books.  They were smaller by design
to make it less mentally intimidating to attempt to "fill up".  One of them is by my "work"
station.  One is by my bed.  One is in my car.  And the last one was designated as a "travel"
journal, which made it along for this trip.

<p>How do I describe what happened on this trip?  It is now pretty far from the trip and
possibly more important things happened since the trip, but that is TBD.  This trip wasn't
as heartwarming as the Vietnam one.  It was mentally challenging on a language-front just
as much though.  Probably the biggest thing in relation to that is how the language barrier
affects the experience I gained.  I've been exploring a lot of energy topics of late and the
deepest point is not being distracted by the illusion of separation.  There are many times
you experience something and regardless of any hurdles, you know energies were connected.
It's probably easier to notice it with the barriers, since normally, the "safety" of
understanding gives the illusion of awareness.</p>

<p>This trip ended up being one of the stepping stones of my personal growth.  Accruing
knowledge and experience, not fully knowing what's next, but testing the openness to the
ultimate truth and how it manifests into all of the pieces.  There are so many nitty-gritty
details that I still haven't shared with most people; but I carry them with me and I was
able to journal most of them, so they feel mostly safe for that reason.</p>

<p>One of the things I fondly appreciated was the welcomeness of people.  Being a picky
eater (and vegetarian), food doesn't entice me.  And it's always a struggle to find good
simple food.  While most everywhere in the world has some form of spice that makes them
special.  When I get to find other versions of simple spices, it is nice.  Funny story,
almost every restaurant that I went to created a special dish just for me.  Like, it was
completely off menu and chef's choice.  That's probably the most memorable part of the
trip.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact was me encountering 3 primary couples with whom I interacted.
I was not at all expecting it and it contributed to the furthering of the
me-getting-over-girls decision that I made.  I've seen many many types of couples and
there are a few types that I think would be cool to have/mesh to create a unique style.
However, each depends on specific personalities.  Most of which I can adapt to; Most of
which I don't want to adapt to (or better, I have no desire, not necessary want).
</p>

<p>As an overall summary, ☝️ I have quite a few answers to live.  They are not all
pieced together; but that's the fun part of the journey.. figuring out how to make it
all work.  This trip was categorized by a lot of comparisons and subconscious linking.
It makes me think about all of the things I didn't know I needed in life.  And all of
the things that changed the direction of my life; knowing where some decisions would
have taken me.  Knowing that the future is now beyond all of them.

    "Let's see how this second flight goes.  There's a lot of spanish.. a lot to
    process without taking a lot of action. [...] I'm just not in a super happy mood, the awkward
    times are messing me up + the language defaults.  Like normally, there isn't any more
    conversation, but the ability to and general fluidity changes the environment, changes
    experiences + perspectives. [...] I don't feel very different from last year, but I feel like
    I know that I'm very different."

<blockquote> "Well.. we did it... We made it to Machu Picchu.   Currently, on the train
back, there's something missing from the trip. [...] There's some disconnection w/ the land
that I'm feeling.  I've been telling people that the energy/connection was felt more in Vietnam
and I didn't even want/was expecting that feeling from there.  I'm probably more rooted over
there in Asia anyway, but this feeling feels deeper/different too. [...] With so much happening
between then and now, I can't effectively ground whether I'm the same person or not.  And the way
that I'm understanding life feels very different."

<blockquote>"That's a thing too though, I still have a great time, it's just a bit detached
and maybe this is the next step of where I have to get to.  Immersion vs. Detachment.  Flowing
while detached? [...] I can't tell if I'm (making decisions) or (not making decisions) and how
the effects are a result of either of those.  I feel like I have pretty good defaults, so me
"not deciding" is a pretty good state.  But there's also the point of if I'm doing good things
in bad ways.  Some things feel like that.  Most are inconclusive.  Some I know are good."

<blockquote>"[...] I'm kind of missing home though.  It reminded me of the feeling I had
on the road trip.  A feeling of displacement, but if I visualize the result, I don't really
want to go to a specific place, but I want to go to a specific feeling.  If I picture myself
home, and think about what I would do, I would do something like 'go to Peru.'"

<blockquote>"[...] 'Home' is counterproductive to growth.  Home creates routines,
complacency, comfort, foundations for stability that goes against taking risks, being open
and doing new things.  Not mutually exclusive.  There are people that demonstrate/display a

<blockquote>"Brooo... what.. why.. how did this all happen in Lima?  Probably the 1st
thought to say was that when we landed in Lima, I INSTANTLY felt better.  I don't think
what I was describing about Cusco was altitude sickness, but the sheer contrast was intense.
[...] The 1st night was spent until 10a and had way too much [redacted].  Probably the
highlight of Lima started w/ fried tofu @ Osaka where we subsequently met Sam + Patricio."

<blockquote>"Okay, so this is it.. The last flight back from Quito to Miami.  I don't
really have feelings about it.  Yes, I'm glad to be able to rest.  Yes, it would've been nice
to stay and properly enjoy Ecuador more.  However, none of that is super important.  It was a
great time and I couldn't have asked for more."
</blockquote>
<p>2026/01/18:</p>
<blockquote>"I was not anticipating to like Ecuador as much as I did ... and it even
gave me more appreciation for [redacted: childhood friend] and my adventures w/ him growing
up.  Spanish was still a struggle, but I definitely felt like I was making progress. but I
had Spanish fatigue from trying to understand it all the time. [...] It's crazy to think
I'm carrying 4 (char, quatro, yon) languages now while stepping back into the music world.
This year is going to be a very interesting one."

<blockquote>"Enough time has passed w/ specific growth checkpoints that it definitely feels like
the things that define life right now are meaningfully different from waht has dictated my life in
previous states.  This era of travel is noth hard to make sense of and also super fluid and has
no kidding benefits that are easy to operate with."
