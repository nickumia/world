Well.. haha.. This is kind of awkward 😅  Who would've thought that I'd make it to Peru?
During New Years, I bought some new HP-themed journaling books.  They were smaller by design
to make it less mentally intimidating to attempt to "fill up".  One of them is by my "work"
station.  One is by my bed.  One is in my car.  And the last one was designated as a "travel"
journal, which made it along for this trip.

<p>2026/01/10: "Already, it's breaking mold.  There is a lot that could happen and it's
testing all of the things I'm struggling through right now."
</p>
<p>2026/01/11: "Let's see how this second flight goes.  There's a lot of spanish.. a lot to
process without taking a lot of action. [...] I'm just not in a super happy mood, the awkward
times are messing me up + the language defaults.  Like normally, there isn't any more
conversation, but the ability to and general fluidity changes the environment, changes
experiences + perspectives. [...] I don't feel very different from last year, but I feel like
I know that I'm very different."
</p>
<p>2026/01/13: "Well.. we did it... We made it to Machu Picchu.   Currently, on the train
back, there's something missing from the trip. [...] There's some disconnection w/ the land
that I'm feeling.  I've been telling people that the energy/connection was felt more in Vietnam
and I didn't even want/was expecting that feeling from there.  I'm probably more rooted over
there in Asia anyway, but this feeling feels deeper/different too. [...] With so much happening
between then and now, I can't effectively ground whether I'm the same person or not.  And the way
that I'm understanding life feels very different."
</p>
<p>2026/01/13: "That's a thing too though, I still have a great time, it's just a bit detached
and maybe this is the next step of where I have to get to.  Immersion vs. Detachment.  Flowing
while detached? [...] I can't tell if I'm (making decisions) or (not making decisions) and how
the effects are a result of either of those.  I feel like I have pretty good defaults, so me
"not deciding" is a pretty good state.  But there's also the point of if I'm doing good things
in bad ways.  Some things feel like that.  Most are inconclusive.  Some I know are good."
</p>
<p>2026/01/14: "[...] I'm kind of missing home though.  It reminded me of the feeling I had
on the road trip.  A feeling of displacement, but if I visualize the result, I don't really
want to go to a specific place, but I want to go to a specific feeling.  If I picture myself
home, and think about what I would do, I would do something like 'go to Peru.'"
</p>
<p>2026/01/14: "[...] 'Home' is counterproductive to growth.  Home creates routines,
complacency, comfort, foundations for stability that goes against taking risks, being open
and doing new things.  Not mutually exclusive.  There are people that demonstrate/display a
healthy combination [...]"
</p>
<p>2026/01/16: "Brooo... what.. why.. how did this all happen in Lima?  Probably the 1st
thought to say was that when we landed in Lima, I INSTANTLY felt better.  I don't think
what I was describing about Cusco was altitude sickness, but the sheer contrast was intense.
[...] The 1st night was spent until 10a and had way too much [redacted].  Probably the
highlight of Lima started w/ fried tofu @ Osaka where we subsequently met Sam + Patricio."
</p>
<p>2026/01/18: "Okay, so this is it.. The last flight back from Quito to Miami.  I don't
really have feelings about it.  Yes, I'm glad to be able to rest.  Yes, it would've been nice
to stay and properly enjoy Ecuador more.  However, none of that is super important.  It was a
great time and I couldn't have asked for more."
</p>
<p>2026/01/18: "I was not anticipating to like Ecuador as much as I did ... and it even
gave me more appreciation for [redacted: childhood friend] and my adventures w/ him growing
up.  Spanish was still a struggle, but I definitely felt like I was making progress. but I
had Spanish fatigue from trying to understand it all the time. [...] It's crazy to think
I'm carrying 4 (char, quatro, yon) languages now while stepping back into the music world.
This year is going to be a very interesting one."

<p>2026/01/18: "Enough time has passed w/ specific growth checkpoints that it definitely feels like
the things that define life right now are meaningfully different from waht has dictated my life in
previous states.  This era of travel is noth hard to make sense of and also super fluid and has
no kidding benefits that are easy to operate with."
