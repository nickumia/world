<h3>Duality.</h3>

<p>This word has always been a puzzle in my life.  I've come 
    to a newfound appreciation for it...</p>

<p>I imagined driving across a fractured, continually splintering 
    America and attempting to stitch it back together with a thread of 
    shared experience.  What I got, instead, was something quieter..
    something far more personal.  It didn't undermine my initial mission
    as much as it showed the flaw in how I would achieve my mission.</p>

<p>It was good to take a road trip across America.</p>
<p>It was also good to imagine how it might unify the nation.</p>

<p>My route? Practical. My mission? Lofty. But my reality? A lot of 
    quiet, personal moments that no grand "unifying" vision could have 
    scripted.  I'd stop in a diner or a library thinking I'd start a 
    conversation to learn something new; instead, I'd end up talking 
    about the size of the pancakes or the dewey decimal system.  I 
    wanted sweeping change, but I got lots of small talk, nods, and the 
    occasional "safe travels" from strangers.</p>

<p>I wanted to be "in this world".. to drive the endless highways.. 
    press my hands against the old-world diner counters.. 
    trace the faded murals of forgotten Main Streets.. 
    but know that I wasn't "of this world", never entirely subsumed by 
    the expectations, the flags, the fronts.  I pictured billboards 
    shouting unity, red-white-and-blue reflections in endless windshields. 
    But the journey whispered something different.  Each person's goals 
    and circumstances tugged at me, pulled me in, and reminded me that 
    you can't travel through America without also traveling into yourself. 
    In wanting to unify a country, I ended up confronting my own shards: 
    personal hopes, heartaches, ambitions I hadn't quite understood. </p>

<p>There were towns where I stopped only for tea and a nod, the way a local 
    barista pauses mid-pour as she'd evaluated whether I was on her 
    wavelength—or not.  There were miles of farmland under skies so vast 
    they made me realize my infinitesimal reality, yet made me feel powerful 
    from the freedom it suggested, and small talk that grew into half-memories: 
    "Where're you headed?" "Nowhere really," I'd say. "Just ... 
    everywhere, I guess." These people ..I was sure I'd connect through 
    grand gestures.. but instead, I connected in the silent reconsiderations, 
    the private glories, the sideways nods in cheap motel hallways.</p>

<p>So.. Here's a prelude to the story of a road trip gone "wrong", because what I 
    achieved wasn't what I had hoped, wasn't any less meaningful; it was simply 
    uncomfortably true. It was a trip that affirmed the true nature of this world: 
    the battle between individualism vs. unity and the existence of disorder within order.</p>

<h3>The first thing, almost everyone struggles with is <b>to be in this 
    world, but not of this world</b>.</h3>

<p>To be <i>in this world</i> simply means living inside the systems 
    around us—the social rules, the daily exchanges, the way we navigate 
    both people and objects just to function.</p>

<p>To be <i>not of this world</i> means remembering that we all came 
    into this life alone, carrying something inside that doesn't fully 
    fit anywhere else; something that isn't, and maybe can't be, shared.</p>

<h3>The natural question that arises from this realization is: 
    <b>What is my goal?</b></h3>

<p>If your goal is <i>this world</i> (what's manifested around us), the 
    answer is to be "fluid" in the world.  You must become one with this 
    world.</p>

<p>If your goal is "<i>the true world</i>" (the world that you exist in 
    outside of this one), the answer is to understand how to "operate in 
    this world", while growing your connection to the truth that you know 
    inside.  (Do you look for the "true world" in this world?  I'm not 
    sure and I'll talk about that in a separate post.)</p>

<h3>This world is defined by its individualism and disorder.  However, 
    it operates of the rules of the "true world" (unity and order).</h3>

<p>Take vlogging, influencers, or even old-school celebrities. On the 
    surface, these people are pure disorder—they operate outside the 
    usual patterns, creating their own voice, pace, and style. They stand 
    apart. Yet their individuality is only possible because of unity: the 
    shared attention of an audience, the collective agreement that their 
    work is worth following.</p>

<p>The crowd of millions of strangers forms an invisible order that 
    supports the chaos of the individual. Without that unity, their unique 
    path would vanish into silence. But with it, the disorder becomes 
    visible, celebrated, and strangely stable.</p>

<p>Many stories rise to success, only to fade with time. Both 
    individualism and unity (disorder and order) are necessary, but they 
    can't dominate equally at once. One will always be stronger, flowing 
    into the other in a constant shift.</p>

<p>One of the most prevalent themes of today is, <b>People try to make 
    this world like the true world</b> (that they carry inside).  It's an 
    instinct as old as humanity; to take the inner order we feel and 
    project it outward.  It is based on the illusion of control (which I'll 
    talk about in a different blog too.)</p>

<ul>
    <li>Religion tries to codify the invisible: to take the truths people 
    sense within and create systems of belief, rituals, and communities 
    that mirror that inner reality.</li>
    <li>Science seeks to map the unseen rules—turning curiosity into 
    equations, measurements, and physical laws that give structure to 
    what otherwise feels chaotic.</li>
    <li>Spirituality often focuses on aligning the outer life with an inner 
    sense of peace, connection, or enlightenment. Meditation, yoga, 
    energy work.. all are ways of making the external match the internal.</li>
    <li>Finance tries to create security and possibility in the material 
    world to reflect the safety or freedom people desire inside. A stable 
    bank account becomes a kind of outer proof of inner stability.</li>
    <li>Medicine works to restore the body to a state of health that matches 
    the vitality someone imagines or remembers feeling within themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on... Every one of these is an attempt to impose the 
    unity and order of the "true world" onto the disorder of the world we 
    share. </p>

<h3>These are all misguided because to be <i>in this world</i>, you 
    can't be <i>in the true world</i>.  We are all perceiving the "true 
    world" through a flawed lens of this world and to be truly in that 
    world, you must leave this one.</h3>

<p>The same way we weren't born into this world knowing how to do 
    everything (how to walk, speak or nagivate its rules).  We can't expect 
    to step into another world and immediately understand how it works.  
    Each realm, whether this one or the "true world", has its own language, 
    patterns, and ways of being. Entering a new one without preparation is 
    like arriving in a foreign country with no map, no translator, and no 
    idea of the customs; you may be there physically, but you won't yet know 
    how to live there.</p>

<p>This world is defined by abundance; an endless variety of people, ideas, 
    and possibilities. That variety is the root of disorder; and from it, 
    individualism naturally emerges.</p>

<p>The "true world", by contrast, is defined by unity; by a deep sense of 
    oneness. At first, unity might sound like it limits abundance, creativity, 
    or freedom. But in reality, it's the opposite. True unity doesn't mean 
    less good; it means one shared truth that everything flows from.  Its 
    truest form being something that we can't comprehend in this world of 
    disorder.</p>

<p>And that's exactly why unity can't fully exist here. In this world, 
    with its infinite differences, we can't all agree on the same "one thing" 
    long enough to sustain it.  It highlights the temporary nature of this 
    world and it actively demonstrates that communities formed in this world 
    will always end in disappointment.</p>

<h3>I saw this truth play out on my road trip across America. </h3>
<p>Every town had its own rhythm, its own version of what "the one thing" should be—
    faith, sports, family, various definitions of fun, guns, nature, freedom—
    each valid in its own way, but never shared across each border I crossed. 
    The graveyard towns, a reminder of the failed communities.</p>

<p>In one place, unity was a small church where everyone knew each other's 
    birthdays. In another, it was the weekly car meet in a grocery store 
    parking lot. But the moment I left, that unity dissolved. It was never 
    mine to keep; it belonged to that place, in that moment.</p>

<p>The road itself became the proof: unity here is always local, always 
    temporary. What lasted for me was the movement between these pockets of 
    togetherness; the disorder of variety holding the whole thing together. 
    And as I drove from one gathering to the next, I realized I wasn't 
    stitching the country into a single fabric. I was traveling through a 
    quilt already made of mismatched squares.  It was beautiful precisely 
    because no two were the same.  At various points in time, the stitching 
    unravels a bit.  At these key moments, the communities can either adapt 
    and re-stitch in new ways given the new changes or dissolve into something 
    entirely new.</p>

<p>I came into the trip thinking I could somehow witness, or even inspire, 
    a thread of unity across the country. I imagined highways connecting more 
    than just places; I imagined hearts, ideas, and experiences linking up, 
    forming some kind of national coherence.</p>

<p>But what I found instead was far more personal, and far more honest. Unity 
    exists, yes; but it's small, fleeting, and intensely local. It's in the 
    smile of a barista who remembers your order, the nod of a stranger at a 
    gas station, the quiet sense of belonging in a diner at 2 a.m.  These 
    moments aren't sweeping or symbolic, but they are real. </p>
<h3>And in their 
    reality, I discovered the truth of my trip: the road wasn't about binding 
    a country together. It was about tracing the edges of my own perception, 
    learning to exist fully in this world while still honoring the sense of 
    something greater I carry inside.</h3>

<p>In that way, I wasn't wrong at all—just wrong about what kind of unity 
    I could find. The trip didn't make America one. It made me more attuned 
    to the unity that exists within each fragment of it, and to the beauty 
    of moving through those fragments without demanding they all conform. 
    That shift.. from desire to acceptance ..is what made the journey 
    meaningful, and what I hope will shape the stories I carry forward.</p>
