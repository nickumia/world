    Since I'm starting to do this out of order, this will be very
    interesting to see how the narrative flows with the gaps filled
    in later.  Ironically, this day was one where I had multiple
    videos.  This was also a very high-impact day since it was
    visiting one of the primary stops I had planned prior to the
    trip.  Multnomah Falls..
</p>
<p>
    A few random things of note:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>I apparently serviced my car this day.. I can't remember
        if it was a routine thing or one of the random issues I
        wanted to check out with the electrical things.
    </li>
    <li>I had stopped by that Chinese restaurant for lunch
        ("very exotic" of me haha..jk)
    </li>
    <li>Funny story, the guy in that cut scene was one of the few
        Oregonians that I spoke with and he was the one who validated
        my observation that people in the NW really like to keep to
        themselves.
    </li>
    <li>It was a very strange day.</li>
    <li>This was also one of the days that I had recorded a longer
        form video.
    </li>
    <li>The rain was an interesting event as well (during the hike
        up to Multnomah Falls).
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The Falls were very crowded.. an occurrence that I was surprised
    by in quite a few places.  Also.. given the nature of the Falls
    and the fact that there are very similar ones elsewhere, it is
    interesting to see which ones "make it" and become popular.
    There's a larger question of what makes certain natural
    attractions stand out while others remain lesser known/visited.
</p>

<p>
    I made it to the Falls a little late, I had imagined it in the
    fall and it probably would've met my expectations better during
    then.  However, with the road trip evolving in the ways that it
    did, this was the best I could do.  
</p>

<p>
    There was an excitement in me that day about a few things which
    counteracted the winter coldness and other disappointments of the
    Northwest.  But yeah, just very strange overall.
</p>

<p>
    I had started today (2025/12/28) wondering what I was up to this
    time during the trip and it definitely feels jarring when I think
    about the space/time/energy I displaced between then and now.  A
    completely different timeline.  A completely different reality.
    A completely different expression of who I was and what I was
    pursuing.  There's a specific day in Helen, MT that I keep
    thinking about and when I get to that day, we'll see what that
    feeling is like again haha..
