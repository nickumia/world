<p>The song choice alone was aspirational for this video haha..</p>

<p>You could see me struggling with some things in some of the begining scenes.
I also haven't mentioned anything about the Airbnb that started this whole trip.
I had never staying in this part of Orlando before and it's known for not being
the safest place.  Probably more I can say, but that's probably enough on that
topic.
</p>

<p>Is this where my stress started to get out of hand?  From some of the scenes,
it seems likely, but to say I was aware of it, I was not.
</p>

<p>Probably the biggest highlight of the day was meeting up with my old buddy
from one of my first real job experiences.  We both started in NJ and made it
to FL haha.. He did say yes to record a coversation about technology, so
hopefully it's not too long before I'm able to edit and release that.  It feels
like years in the making, just being able to meet up with him here, so it's crazy
that we actually did do it.  Just like so many you'll see in these videos, I've
made no shortage of friends in life, but keeping up with everyone is difficult.
</p>

<p>Anyone who knows me, knows I am known for pushing myself super hard.  If you
can't see that in this video, you don't know me well enough haha..
