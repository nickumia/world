<p>This is so wild..</p>
<p>There are so many thoughts, and hopefully, me saying this one
time will be enough for this mini-series I'm doing here.  Other
things to note.. video style is sooo different from the style that
I used during the final videos.</p>
<p>This day only had one video and I'm surprised at how much I was
able to convey in it.  There was so much uncertainty.  So many high
hopes for what might have come out of the trip.</p>
<p>Earlier on in the trip I was able to have longer days.  But as time
progresses, I got really burnt out and just super tired all of the
time.</p>
<p>It's wild to think that.. That mandir was the first stop on the
trip and a pretty significant one.  I don't know.. I feel like the
things I want to reflect on need more of the trip to have "occurred"
and it technically has, but from this Day 1 video, it hasn't.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I had accomplished a lot that day,</p>
<ul>
  <li>I was social, talked to people in a semi-private forum.</li>
  <li>I had enjoyed myself, eating doubles and visiting Disney Springs.</li>
  <li>I did people watching at Disney Springs.</li>
  <li>I even met more random strangers throughout the day
    (like at some shops I had stopped at).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I know for a fact that I put a lot of pressure on myself.  Not this
day specifically, I had planned to spend 3-4 days in Orlando, so I felt
like I had some time left to do more.  But I know the expectations in
my head were real high.</p>

<p>One of the other major things to mention here is that, I was and
still am very intimately familiar with Orlando.  Having lived there
for a few years, and traveled many many times.  It is part of the
geolocation that I call Home (i.e. Florida).  I have more bitter
memories specifically in Orlando, but it was a time in my life and
I respect it as a part of my growth and development.</p>

<p>To steal the words from the Drone show, "Dreams that Soar"
definitely represented the vibes I had about the trip so far.
It's probably worth mentioning, for the topic of "tech integration",
coordinated Drone performances are not new, but the fact of how
mainstream they have become in certain contexts.  I'm sure they still
amaze some people, but as a society, it's become more normalized
than I think people admit.</p>
