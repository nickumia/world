<p>This is so wild..</p>
<p>There are so many thoughts, and hopefully, me saying this one
time will be enough for this mini-series I'm doing here.  Other
things to note.. video style is sooo different from the style that
I used during the final videos.</p>
<p>This day only had one video and I'm surprised at how much I was
able to convey in it.  There was so much uncertainty.  So many high
hopes for what might have come out of the trip.</p>
<p>Earlier on in the trip I was able to have longer days.  But as time
progresses, I got really burnt out and just super tired all of the
time.</p>
<p>It's wild to think that.. That mandir was the first stop on the
trip and a pretty significant one.  I don't know.. I feel like the
things I want to reflect on need more of the trip to have "occurred"
and it technically has, but from this Day 1 video, it hasn't.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I had accomplished a lot that day,</p>
<ul>
  <li>I was social, talked to people in a semi-private forum.</li>
  <li>I had enjoyed myself, eating doubles and visiting Disney Springs.</li>
  <li>I did people watching at Disney Springs.</li>
  <li>I even met more random strangers throughout the day
    (like at some shops I had stopped at).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I know for a fact that I put a lot of pressure on myself.  Not this
day specifically, I had planned to spend 3-4 days in Orlando, so I felt
like I had some time left to do more.  But I know the expectations in
my head were real high.</p>
