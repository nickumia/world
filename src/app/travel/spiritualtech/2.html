<p>Damn...</p>
<p>I did a lot this day.  Some really crazy feelings and vibes,</p>
<ul>
  <li>That intro scene of my old car...</li>
  <li>Having to work</li>
  <li>Doing that intense survey quest in the park</li>
  <li>Exploring downtown</li>
  <li>Visiting familiar places</li>
  <li>Me thinking I could capture technology observations in pictures haha</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>One of my favorite memories from that day... I was trying to collect survey data in
the park and I was trying to overcome my social anxiety.  It was a great moment, but
I kind of failed miserably at getting survery responses haha.. There was this jogger
who had seen me standing there for a while and after I had "packed up shop for the 'hour'",
I was sitting on a bench and the same jogger came over to talk to me.  She commented that
she saw me and was curious about what I was doing.  I ended up getting her response; it was
just so random and cool haha..
</p>

<p>Looking at this video from a "what I accomplished" standpoint, I know I was at a very
different energy level at the beginning vs. the end of the trip.  So much potential and so
much excitemnt for what awaited me on the trip.  It was only Day 2, but yeah... so much more
to follow.
</p>

<p>One of the biggest things that is a complete undertone of the video is just how familiar
Orlando was to me and how it was a transition of mentality from what I know to how I explore
what I don't know.
