<p>I haven't kept up with these reflections, but just processing
a lot recently, in NY, and re-watching HSM and getting a bunch of
vibes.
</p>

<p>I had considered this the "first real driving segment" for the
trip.. Driving to Orlando felt like cheating since I had already
lived there.  If only I knew that this "driving segment" would be
one of the lighter ones.  I want to say that I'm surprised I did
it in the morning on a Wednesday.  But life was just very different
back then.</p>

<p>Even the video style haha.. what seems like sooooooo much effort
compared to what I have the motivation to do currently.  It was
definitely nice to be able to try out different styles.  Little
did I know that events would unfold and I would lose dash cam
recording ability.</p>

<p>I remember making making it to Tallahassee and being creeped out
but also pleasantly surprized with how it felt as well.  It felt
like a cozy little spot to have gone to college (if that was in
my cards, but it wasn't.)  "Cozy" is also a word that I mean in a
very unorthodox way in this particular instance.
</p>

<p>Right now, I'm just in a very weird place with lots of emotions
running high.  Funny thing, I don't remember working this day.  I'm
sure I did, most days I had to have, but it's just interesting that
I had such great experiences that it's not the primary memory.
