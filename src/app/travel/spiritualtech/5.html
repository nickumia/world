<p>48 seconds haha.. It's still wild to me how subtle, but meaningful,
    the changes in video editing styles are from the beginning to
    to the end of the trip. Arguably, I fit a lot in 48s with mixed
    video + picture content.</p>

<p>Just to recap what happened this day:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Visited Governor's Square Mall</li>
    <li>Visited the Railroad Square Art District</li>
</ul>

<p>...</p>

<p>It was only two main stops, but I had met a lot of people and got
    a lot of exposure in them.  It was a Thursday and quieter.
</p>

<p>That note I left in the airbnb..</p>
<p>That first person in the video, a retired army guy..</p>
<p>That mall and memories of time I spent growing up in malls..</p>
<p>Macy's haha..</p>
<p>Those amazing art pieces on those walls..</p>
<p>That second guy in the video, I feel like I vaguely remember
    connecting with him over something NY-related and there was
    definitely some retirement conversation in the mix.
</p>
<p>That third guy in the video, traveling there for work..</p>
<p>That throwback movie store..</p>

<p>All vibes of a place and time that, may not be dying, but is
    changing in uncertain ways.  ..will those art pieces be there
    in 50 years?  Will that mall still be there?  What will happen
    to that movie shop?  The either $3 or $5 popcorn for a free movie
    was super dope.. Seeing people go to rent movies, like blockbusters
    and the before days...
</p>

<p>Day 5 and, looking back, it feels like it was just another
    part of my life, not even super "road-trippy".  Definitely a
    higher day in general.
