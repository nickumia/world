<p>This is going to be a unique one haha.. Yesterday was Thanksgiving
    and everyone was sending "Thanksgiving day" things, so...
    I said I would send this video that I made last year on
    Thanksgiving.  It also motivated me to make my first epilogue
    video for the trip.</p>

<p>There's a lot to say here haha.. apart from me jumping from Day 5
    to Day 108 (of course I'll fill in the days in between eventually).
    I'm in LA here and specifically driving to a bunch of iconic
    places..</p>

<ul>
    <li>A places in my family's history</li>
    <li>Fast + Furious 7, Brian x Dom Parting Drive</li>
    <li>Warner Bros Studio</li>
    <li>Griffith Observatory</li>
    <li>Hiking up to the Hollywood Sign</li>
    <li>(probably a few tinier places along the way)</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably of interesting note are two things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Song, Gobble Gobble</li>
    <li>The nature of the day</li>
</ul>

<p>Literally, there are not enough songs about Thanksgiving and this
    song was super cool when I found it.  Thanksgiving has been an
    interesting theme over my life.  From school, there's all of the
    history and theory that surrounds it that, for better or worse,
    doesn't get appreciated enough.  From family, there have been a
    select few Thanksgivings that we celebrated with family that are
    memorable in their own ways.  In recent years, I haven't done
    much to celebrate it, save for lots of reflection and thinking.</p>

<p>As I alluded to above, I have mixed memories about how the day has
    been; however, it is definitely meant to be a social holiday.
    I don't have any issues celebrating it solo (as I did on the trip),
    but it always makes me think about things, people and experiences.
    Even if a big family event doesn't happen, it's always nice to
    have people close and accessible.
</p>

<p>In terms of thoughts for this day, it's funny.. I actually have
    two videos that I recorded that day that capture thoughts and
    it's very interesting the topics that I've focused on.
</p>

<p>In general, during the trip, I didn't attempt to find specific
    connections between all of the things I was doing.  However, I
    always new everything was connected.  Reflecting now, it is wild
    to me how connected it is and how much I'm able to put pieces
    together.  There's always the question of "free will" (i.e.
    how much am I "choosing" to think about the things that I am);
    however, that's a different conversation and, for what it's
    worth, free will in this context can probably best be described
    as the natural flow of thoughts and experiences.  "Naturally"
    being that "I have chosen the things up til this point" which
    has made me "want to choose the things at this point."
</p>

<p>Overall.. it was a fun day.. honestly I probably can say I
    enjoyed it more than Christmas (during the trip); but we'll
    come back to that point when I do that reflection :p
