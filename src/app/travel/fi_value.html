<p>
    Spending a year driving across America gave me a different
    relationship with time, work, and what I thought financial
    independence (FI) would actually mean. FI used to feel like the
    "finish line"; the moment life would finally "open up." But as
    I get closer to it, I'm starting to ask a more honest question:
</p>

<h3>
    What meaningful change am I actually buying?
</h3>

<p>
    Right now I'm a remote worker. I have a flexibility that is
    as much as I ever thought FI would give me, an autonomy,
    and the ability to explore while still earning.
    The main limitation isn't time. It's direction. I'm building
    someone else's mission in primarily government contracting settings.
    My days are shaped by someone else's priorities, someone else's
    definitions of progress. FI feels like the opportunity to finally
    work on <i>my</i> ideas full-time.
</p>

<p>
    Don't get me wrong.  Traveling while working remotely is no easy
    task.  It requires a lot of planning, a lot of discipline, and a
    lot of sacrifice.  It's not for everyone.  And as I've mentioned
    before, it's not for me (long term).  Short term, it can be fun
    and refreshing.  But it's really nice to have a space to call
    your own.  Not a physical space, but most times our mental spaces
    latch on to physical spaces.  I digress..
</p>

<p>
    Having time to reflect after coming back after the year of
    travel make me realize:
</p>

<h3>
    Even with FI, my day-to-day might not change that much.
</h3>

<p>
    My purpose won't magically rearrange itself the moment I hit a
    number. My curiosity, my desire to solve real problems with
    technology, to help <b>real people</b>, my tendency to tinker
    and build; those already exist.  And FI doesn't create them.
    It only removes excuses.
</p>

<p>
    The more I think about it, the more it makes sense that FI is
    less of a lifestyle shift and more of a psychological one. I
    already have freedom. I already have mobility. I already have the
    tools. What I don't have is the mindset to act on them.  What FI
    gives is permission. Not permission from society. Permission from
    myself to know that some responsibilities are taken care of and
    I have authority to act on my own values.
</p>

<p>
    But that permission only matters if I'm clear about what I
    actually care about.  Travel makes this brutally obvious:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Money can pay for miles, food, and nights in new places.
    But it can't tell you who you are when you arrive.
</blockquote>

<p>
    And on the road, I kept returning to this idea:
</p>

<h3>
    Money is the currency of transaction. Value is the identity of
    the transaction.
</h3>

<p>
    If I'm not pursuing something meaningful today, I won't
    magically pursue it once I reach FI.  I thought that if I
    reached FI, I would finally have the means to focus on
    what mattered.  That was a lie I was telling myself.
</p>
<p>
    If I'm not building what I believe in now, I won't suddenly
    start once the number turns green.  Freedom means nothing if
    I don't know what I want to do with it.  (I will add a small
    caveat that there is a physical limit on energy/effort and a
    small part of FI frees up space within that limit.)
</p>

<p>
    The road helped me realize that the real work, the identity work,
    starts long before FI.  And maybe that's the point.  FI shouldn't
    be the moment you start living your life.  It should be the moment
    you remove the last excuse not to.  (It doesn't prevent new
    excuses from cropping up, but you should be able to handle them
    given the growth to this point.)
</p>

<p>
    The more distance I get from the trip, the more the question
    shifts from:
</p>

<blockquote>
    "How close am I to FI?"
</blockquote>

<p>
to
</p>

<blockquote>
    "How aligned am I with the value I want to create?"
</blockquote>

<p>
    Because no amount of financial independence replaces the feeling
    of creating something that actually matters, something of real
    value defined by the true depth of your existence.
