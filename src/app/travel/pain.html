<p>Pain.</p>

<p>What does it mean to have something?</p>

<p>What does it mean to have pain?</p>

<p>Pain is a symptom.  But often times, it is so strong that
    it distracts us from its true cause.  It is a signal that 
    something is wrong.  Maybe not wrong, but different.  Many
    times, we hold on to our pain.  It latches onto us or we
    latch onto it and it masks our true selves.
</p>

<p>I got the motivation for this post during one of my darker
    moments.  Right now, I'm in a better place.  But even given
    that, talking through this is bringing those dark places back.
    What I've come to know as the rollercoaster of highs and lows
    is probably what modern science would just call depression.
    Sure.. I'd be more "normal" if I used some of the mechanisms
    that modern science recommends.  But <b>What is normal?</b>
    I truly believe that trying to fit a mold that society is
    constantly changing is madness.  Everyone is unique.  Everyone
    is special.  Everyone has their own path to figure out.
    What does this have to do with <i>pain</i>?
</p>

<p>There are going to be a lot of tangents here, so be prepared.</p>

<p>Pain. Hurt.  Ache.  Soreness.  Discomfort.  Tenderness.  Throb.
Twinge.  Pang.  Irritation.  Agony.  Torment.  Torture.
Excruciation.  Cramp.  Spasm.  Stitch.  Smarting.  Stinging.
Throbbing.  Stabbing.   Suffering.  Anguish.  Distress.
Misery.  Sorrow.  Grief.  Heartache.  Heartbreak.  Woe.  
Tribulation.  Affliction.  Despair.  Sadness.  Bitterness.
Wretchedness.  Desolation.  Nuisance.  Annoyance.  Pest.  Headache.
Bother.  Vexation.  Irritation.  Trial.  Trouble.  Plague.</p>

<p>(If it wasn't already evident, this post took many attempts
to make it to the end.  **cough cough** Third attempt in the
making)</p>

<p>When the feeling isn't overwhelmingly dark or negative or crushing..
the general thing that happens is that I get flashbacks of places
I've been, experiences I've had.. but it's more the feeling
during the experience and not specific tangible things themselves.
</p>

<p>It's really hard... It's not that I have regrets and it's not
quite that I'm stuck in moments, but it feels like a part of me
relives the feelings.. Or rather, something about me doesn't know
that the feelings are not in the present.
</p>

<p>Random side tangent.. I've gotten the pain in my neck somewhat
manageable.  Just lots of stretching, motion, cracking and attempting
to reduce stress.  My body has changed.  It is different.  I don't know
if I will ever feel like how I did before the pain came.  And oddly
enough, that's kinda the theme behind this post.
</p>

<p>There's something that I'm struggling with.. but do I have it?
Is it even the thing that I'm feeling and living?  Or is it something
else?  I know it's real.. maybe?  It's as real as anything else in the
set of things that I share with you all.
</p>

<p>And that's another thing.. what's important and what's not?  What's
part of the reality that I'm creating (or is being created around me)
or that exists or doesn't?  I feel like I'm just floating, life is
somewhat passing me by and I have way more answers (personal answers)
than I did when I graduated high school.  But it doesn't feel like
enough?  What am I missing?  What is causing this pain?
</p>

<p>Many of the things I'm feeling may be "natural", but it's not
clear because I haven't heard anyone else I really know talk about
it.  The conversations that I've had with some people are also just
different because they are different.  And that definitely seems okay.
Part of this is exciting to reflect on, but it doesn't make living
with it any easier.  There are so many tangents about dreams, about
the universe, about energy, about life, about communication,
consciousness, anything and everything.  And it all stems from this
void.. this unknown.. this gap in knowledge.
</p>

<p>I'm in a flow that'll get me somewhere.  The question isn't about
if it'll get me where I want to be.  I don't know if having an
answer about "where I want to be" is the point.  It's not even a
question about uncertainty because I know there's nothing that's
really certain in life.  Some may say that's the problem, that I'm
not grounded enough and I let things be uncertain.  But I think those
people are blinded by the illusion of control.  There are many out
there that do know about what I'm going through (as in they have
gone through some version of it themselves).  Their answers were
not satisfying to me, nor should they really be.
</p>

<p>At my current knowledge level, I could continue writing for years
and years and be just as stuck as I am right now.  This feeling
isn't new.  I've felt it for as long as I've been conscious and
aware about my consciousness.  It's just become better understood
over the years...
</p>

<p>Honestly.. I was at a loss of what to focus on next in my
journaling (like my real paper journaling), but with the completion
of this post, I think it's clear this will be the topic that I
focus on there.
