<h3>One of the biggest unanswered questions I have is...</h3>
<p>What does it mean to accomplish something?</p>
<p>Coming back from this road trip, I feel confronted by this question once again.
It feels like every time I accomplish something, it doesn't satisfy whatever it is
that I'm looking for.</p>

<p>(Side note: If you don't know my story and what I've "accomplished" so far in life,
there are many things I can list that would be impressive to many people, but there are
many things others have accomplished that would be even more impressive.)</p>

<p>There are so many answers to this question.. the problem is just that none of them
are the right answer for me.  I technically have the answer I "need" which is just,
worldly pursuits will always lead to disappointment if done for personal gain.</p>

<p>I need very little, if anything at all, from any specific people.  There are lots
of things that are inherently better when done with people, but the question of "need"
vs. "want" just makes it more complicated.</p>

<p>The last two months or so, since I've returned, have been really hard.  Overcoming
the fatigue.  Reconciling all of the different things that happened.  
</p>

<p>The thought for this post came to me this morning, but of course it's 13 hours later
and I don't have all of the same thoughts that would've made this so much more successful.
This all just sounds like bullshit and it's annoying me to write as much as it is for
you to read.  It's annoying me so much that the pain in my neck is preventing me from
not being annoyed.</p>

<h3>You should probably just start reading here.</h3>

<p>"Long ago", someone told me ("one of"?) the easiest way to live life was to be able
to connect everything with some unifying thread.  It makes total sense theorectically.
Practically, it's a nightmare.  It's probably a large reason why I have so much stress
sometimes.  The reason being that most of the time, the worlds that you have to interact
with are just too different.  Too many people are operating under too many different
rules and conditions.  It's not that everyone and everything needs to play nice with
each other.  But there is an expectation that the worlds won't overlap when you move
between them.</p>

<p>Being the main character in your own story, you build a world with the pieces you
want.  The problem, naturally, is that there are soooo many main characters and we are
all sharing the same physical world while having different mental worlds.  The daily
struggles we all face are primarily because we are rubbing up against others with
different values and goals.</p>

<h3>That word.. Values</h3>

<p>It was a key word that represented a fundamental concept of the road trip.  Everyone
wanted to be closer to their values.  I think, subconsciously, there's a hope that values
are much more similar than they actually are. <i>(that's what makes a community a community,
a nation a nation and what gives people who share any commonality a sense of belonging)</i></p>

<p>Even with the people I consider closest in my life, I've felt at odds with them
coming back from this trip.  There are so many things that I experienced, things that
I had planned to incorporate into my life when I got back and it's just really hard because
they don't mesh well with most of the people.  Some changes mesh with some people.
Others with others.  But it's so messy, it's hard to manage.  Again, theoretically, it's
really nice to think there's some connective thread.  Perhaps you believe you can live
your life as this connective thread.</p>

<p>That's the thing though.. I have all of the answers, but applying them feels
impossible.</p>

<p>I wake up late.  I struggle to find the motivation to do what I need to.  I
try to keep my load light to try and build energy to move forward.  But I haven't been
able to be net-positive energy enough to build up a reservoir large enough to tolerate
the pain.</p>

<h3>My answer.</h3>

<p>My answer is this question, "How do we define goals, specifically in a way that
doesn't breed conflict?"</p>

<p>"Goal" here is essentially just "the next thing."  It's not about being better.
It's not about solving problems.  It's just whatever it is people "want" to do.
Partying.  Getting a job.  Traveling.  Starting a business.  Spending time with
family.  Keeping things clean.  Gardening.  Exercising.  Painting.  Being productive.
Being unproductive.  Building weapons.  Using weapons.  There is literally no end
to the list.</p>

<p>"Conflict" here is just "competing priorities."  It doesn't mean death, destruction,
chaos.  Those are naturally existing and they may actually be goals in it of itself.
The best way to describe this is, if everyone was a stranger to everyone else, living
in their own world, I would not have any question to answer.  There would be no possibility
for conflict if there is not overlap.</p>

<p>There's no reason to ask the question that doesn't exist though.  This reality that
we experience itself is a false one.  What point is there in asking to create another
false reality, no different from the Infinite Tsukuyomi from Naruto.  Naruto.  Men in
Black.  Various Marvel.  Various Space/Alien movies.  Various Anime.  It feels like
anything I watch has some relevance here.</p>

<p>Like I said, I had a much better phrasing of most of this this morning, so I'm gonna
spend some time trying to get that back.  But that I think is the "next thing" for all
of this.</p>

<p>All of this is an attempt to define the value that I am adding into the world; while
I protect the things that I value.</p>

<h3>"So you're gonna turn into some goal-setting guru?"</h3>

<p>Nah.  I want to say, if anyone has been on a personal growth journey long enough,
they either settle with something they find or they attempt to go "all the way" to 
self-realization, "enlightenment" or whatever is at the end-end.  You could say this is
me "settling" with something on the way, but with it being a question, it's probably
just the next step in getting all the way to the end-end.</p>

<p>I write all of this as if I have a firm foundation and starting point.  I don't.</p>

<p>I still have a bit of housekeeping to do.  I said I was gonna do that when I got
back from the trip and my initial pass didn't really get me very far.  Let's see how
this second pass goes.  And we'll see if it sets me up better to keep going from there.</p>
