    <div class="preface-title">The Theory</div>
    <p>There was a book that I came across, early on in my
        spiritual exploration and I had taken pictures of this
        text.  Until recently, it lived in an unsaved always
        open text file.  Reading it now, there are things about
        it that I don't like.  However, it was an important
        point of awareness development.

Q. Why is your religion called Sanatan Dharma?
</p>

<blockquote>
A. Because it has not been started by any particular personality
but is founded on some eternal truths which hold good forever,
for example:
<ul>
    <li>God is Sat, Chit, Anand, meaning Truth, Consciousness and
        Blissfulness, which are eternal.</li>
    <li>The innermost spirit of man, which is his true existence,
        is beyond change and, therefore, eternal. The changing part
        of man's being are his fine and physical bodies.</li>
    <li>Our dharma is not an organised religion which depends upon
        certain creeds. On the other hand our dharma is determined in
        accordance with the character of the people - individually
        and collectively.</li>
    <li>Our scriptures say that: “Ekam Sat Bipra Bahudhaa Badanti”
        (Rig Veda) meaning, God is one, yet different people call Him
        by different names.</li>
    <li>All men, in their essence, are equal.</li>
    <li>All religions lead to the same goal.</li>
    <li>The doctrine of karma meaning - as you sow so shall you reap,
        which is nothing but the eternal law of causes and effects.</li>
    <li>The doctrine of Maya means the transitory nature of the world
        which is sometimes deceptive and which is by itself not
        independent.</li>
    <li>The doctrine of transmigration of souls or rebirth: This is
        based on the doctrine of karma. Man has to be born again and
        again until he has been able to free himself from all
        desires.</li>
    <li>God, being all-powerful, can, if He likes, incarnate Himself
        at different times in different parts of the world.</li>
    <li>Devotion to parents, guru and husband is a very important
        teaching of Hinduism. This is also a universal truth because
        obedience to elders lies in the very nature of man.</li>
    <li>Unity in diversity - by this Hindus believe that in all the
        diverse phenomena of the world, there is a unifying factor -
        Universal Soul.</li>
</ul>

<p>Q. What is the harm when a religion is founded by a particular
    personality?</p>

<blockquote>
A. After a time, should the events in the life of that personality
be proved something different from how people believed before,
then the whole structure of that religion will be at stake.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. Who are these personalities like Rama and Krishna?</p>

<blockquote>
A. They are God incarnates or Avatars, who have contributed much to
the progress of Hinduism. Though the value of their contribution is
immeasurable yet the existence of the Hindu religion never depends
upon them.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. If there is no founder of Hindu religion then how did it start?</p>

<blockquote>
A. In the beginning of each cycle of creation some wise persons who are
very much elevated from previous creations and whom the Hindus call
Maharishi are born. In their samadhi or close contact with God,
divine knowledge, both secular and spiritual, dawns upon them. Such
knowledge is called Vedas, which in turn gave rise to Hinduism.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. How did the name 'Hindu' come?</p>

<blockquote>
A. The Western invaders of India in ancient times used to call the
inhabitants of the Eastern side of the Sindhu river (Indus river)
'Hindus', the word being very near to the word 'Sindhu'. The word
'Hindu' has a geographical significance, but according to Sri Radha
Krishnan, it has now a more cultural significance than a geographical
one.
</blockquote>

<h3>CREATION</h3>

<p>Q. Are there many creations and dissolutions?</p>

<blockquote>
A. Yes, according to the Vedas there are many creations and
dissolution, and with every dissolution, seeds are left for the
new creation. Creation means variation, for all seeds cannot be
equal.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. Who has created the universe, God or Nature (Prakriti)?</p>

<blockquote>
A. God has created the universe but through Nature. The whole
creation has come out of Him, and Him alone.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. Where was man first created?</p>

<blockquote>
A. In Trivastaba, which is now Tibet, on the north of India
(according to Hindu belief).
</blockquote>

<p>Q. Who were first created?</p>

<blockquote>
A. Seven great sages: Marichi, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha,
Kratu and Vashishta. And four Manus: Sanak, Sanandan, Sanatan and
Sanatkumar. All men are born of them. (Gita 10 - 6).
</blockquote>

<p>Q. How did creation become possible?</p>

<blockquote>
A. Before creation, God was alone, Who may be termed as Absolute or
Impersonal God, who is Abaammanasagochara (Who cannot be thought of
or spoken of). In that Absolute state, a kind of vibration was felt
which in turn brought forth the primal Sound or Word - Om. Thoughts
for creation such as, "Let there be light and there was light", or
"ekoham bahusyam", came in the divine mind. That is how the creation
became possible.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. How did creation start?</p>
<blockquote>
A. Creation started with Chaos or Matter-not-solidified.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. How long did the unsolidified matter take to get solidified?</p>
<blockquote>
A. Thousands of years.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. What is the process of creation?</p>
<blockquote>
A. God then created space (Aakaasha); from space, wind was
created; from wind, fire; from fire, water, the earth; from the
earth, herbs, from herbs, food; from food, person (Yajurveda
Taittiriya Upanishad 1-2-1). The sun, the moon, the heaven and
the other regions and everything else were created as in previous
creations.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. What is the process of dissolution?</p>
<blockquote>
A. Just opposite to the process of creation.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. After creating everything, did God remain aloof from the
    created things?</p>
<blockquote>
A. No. Having created them, He entered into them, for example,
comprises — subtle water 1/21/2, subtle earth 1/81/8, subtle fire
1/81/8, subtle air 1/81/8, subtle space 1/81/8, (From Vichaar
Chandrodaya).</p>

<p>Q. Does any particular organ gather strength from any particular
element?</p>

<blockquote>
A. Yes. Each organ has its corresponding element from which it gets
power.
</blockquote>

<p>Q. Which organ corresponds to which element?</p>

<blockquote>
A. The organ 'ear' is corresponding to 'space'. That means 'ear'
functions through 'space'. In the same way, 'nose' functions through
'earth', 'tongue' through 'water', 'skin' through 'air', 'eye' through
'fire' (From “Vichaar Chandrodaya”).
</blockquote>

<p>Q. What is the age of creation?</p>

<blockquote>
A. The Western people according to the Bible believe that creation
only 6,000 years old. But with the scientific discoveries and the
unearthing of some ancient relics, people have started to believe that
man lived in this world quite a few million years before. The date of
creation, according to orthodox Hindu view, is much more ancient. The
question still remains open, for something may in future throw some
more light on this matter.
