<p>It's almost the end of the day.. 23:20:15..16..17.. and counting
I just finished watching "The Intern."  I was watching the Spider-Man
movies (the original ones haha..) I was scheduled to do the last one
Spider-Man 3, but I knew the vibe and it was not where I was at.
</p>

<p>By chance, I had happened across this movie and something about
Anne Hathaway and just the memories of watching her movies when I
was younger felt like it would hit.
</p>

<p>I've been on an uptrend of late, recently coming out of a low
series.  Not sure how long this period would last, I felt it wavering
throughout the day.
</p>

<p>One of the other big things related to the context here is just
that today is 9/11.  It's been on my mind since September had started.
It's been a long time since the date had gotten its name and for the
most part, it is getting lost to history, just like many things that
have come and past.
</p>

<p>There are a lot of things in the air, but nothing specifically on
my mind.  I am known for these deep feelings, but being able to
describe and express them does not come easy.  I feel a lot of
pressure, but like usual, it's mostly self-imposed.  I'm supposed
to be writing a report for work and hopefully I'll still have juice
to do that after this.
</p>

<p>I don't know who I'm really writing this for, at the minimum it's
future me, but it doesn't really feel like that's it.  Another part
of this feeling that I'm feeling is that I want to be useful to
someone, just one person is enough.  Coming from Spiderman, "sometimes
to do what's right, you have to give up what you want."  And even Ben
in The Intern, living a selfless life and just being able to add value.
That's what I want and I feel like it's the right thing to do too..
</p>

<p>But something's just not adding up properly..</p>

<p>One of the thoughts I had on my mind earlier was just the deja-vu
that I feel.  There are so many things that happen that I know I've
experienced before.  Movies I've seen that are "now being released."
Encounters with people that I've "never met before."  Events I've
gone to that I know have happened before.  Part of me knows that if
I'm able to access something, I'll be able to understand this feeling
that I'm reliving a life that I've lived before.
</p>

<p>Yet another part of me thinks about the problem of trying to add
value into a world that we know is not real.  That's probably the
biggest thing that prevents me from doing all the things that I
"need" to.  When I was in school, I didn't have all of this awareness,
which made it easier to just push through things.  Building momentum
was also easier.
</p>

<p>I've talked about wanting to declutter my life, but that's not
really gonna solve the root of these questions/problems that I
mentioned here.
</p>

<p>Short story long, there are a lot of distractions.</p>

<p>And it's funny hah.. I don't get distracted by the distractions.
But that doesn't stop the distractions from existing.  It's kind of
like all of the little micro-organisms that we can't see.  They are
still there, doing things, but we don't think about them as
distractions or specifically inhibiting us in any way.
</p>

<p>Something else that The Intern made me appreciate just a little
bit just now.  I've always had an aversion to industry, money, the
corporate world, etc.  Startups are a special part of all of that.
But the answer that startup founders have is that they've created
the space where they "belong" and can do the things that they think
they want.  Whether it's real or not isn't the question, but it
gives them a way of achieving something.  I feel like many of them
just make compromises to be able to operate in that space, but
they value the benefits more than the cost of the compromises.
</p>

<p>One of the things I've been thinking about since during the
road trip was creating a space like that for me.  Not bound by the
rules created by society..
</p>

<p>That is what I want to spend my energy on.  I think that's what
will get me closer to solving the things I talked about earlier.
And me saying that, makes me feel like it's just another symptom.
</p>

<p>I guess that's what this post is really about.  The symptoms
of what I'm feeling right now and maybe help me to put it more
together.
</p>

<p>I really wish I was writing these in the HP journals I have,
but writing takes more energy than typing at the moment.. so
this is the best we got..
