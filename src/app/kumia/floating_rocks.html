    <div class="preface-title">The Theory</div>
    <p>In this blog, I will attempt to convey this theory. You will
    attempt to refute it.</p>

    <p>The theory, if you will allow me, is about choosing where to
    anchor your attention, i.e. be present now or plan for the
    future.  It rests on two main ideas that define how we
    experience time:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>The Hidden Architecture of Identity (The Glimpses
            or micro-moments):</b> True self-definition is housed in
            intense, brief micro-moments that offer a glimpse into a
            depth of life beyond the ordinary, planned illusion. We
            spend our lives chasing the infinite; but over the
            course of a day, micro-seconds matter; and over the
            course of a human life, a grand total of minutes matter;
            and the infinite is often captured in these glimpses if
            we are able to see them.</li>
        <li><b>The Necessary Anchor (The Awareness):</b> A
            fulfilling journey requires actively cultivating the
            awareness to recognize these defining moments. This
            means mastering the tension between mapping the future
            (Planner) and surrendering to the now (Presence) and
            consciously choosing where to set the anchor of our
            attention. It is in this conscious choice that we find
            the true essence of living.</li>
    </ol>

<p>I was in the pool this evening, as the sun began to set;
    the sun glistening gold across the water.  The water's natural
    beauty was in full display; a cleansing feeling that washes
    away attachment and frees the soul...</p>

<p>
    It's an outdoor pool, and the air had that perfect, suspended
    quality; a breeze that wasn't cold, just cool enough to create a
    sharp contrast against the warmth of the exertion.
</p>

<p>
    Swimming is usually my off-switch. It's the best form of exercise
    to clear my mind and rebalance my body.  Most of the time, I'm
    just on auto-pilot in the water: breath, stroke, turn, repeat.
    I'll focus on a mantra, or just count the laps, or zone in on
    the specific burn in a muscle group and, without realizing it,
    everything else fades away.
</p>

<p>
    But there are these tiny gaps. Usually, right when I hit the wall,
    I pause for a moment. In that pause, the brain reorients itself
    and I see the world in a very unique way.  It was in that moment
    that an image, an idea, a feeling emerged.. navigating those
    floating rocks.
</p>

<p>
    I started imagining myself stepping through a series of
    floating rocks in mid-air.  They are static.  Or at least they
    seem to be.  It's hard to tell in constant motion.  But they seem
    to go on endlessly.  There was no beginning of the idea, nor any
    meaningful end in sight.  It was just a continuous motion of
    walking on these rocks, where the sole goal is to not fall or
    miss one.
</p>

<p>
    We're walking on one now, and we have to move forward. The
    tension.  The real struggle.  It's where we put our eyes.
</p>

<p>
    There is a seduction to planning. We want to map out the next
    five, ten, twenty rocks. We want to engineer the path to the
    future. But the energy required to calculate the trajectory
    of the tenth rock while you're balancing on the current one
    is exhausting. And often, by the time you get to the next rock,
    the path has shifted anyway. The plan was an illusion of control.
</p>

<p>
    So, the alternative is to narrow the aperture. You focus
    entirely on the single stone right in front of you. You commit
    to the now. This increases your accuracy for that one step, sure.
    You're less likely to slip today. But does it make the journey
    reliable? Or does it just mean you're moving confidently toward
    an obstacle you didn't see coming because you were looking at
    your feet?
</p>

<p>
    In fact, the act of looking ahead is vital. It's exactly like
    driving a car: if you only focus on the asphalt a few feet in
    front of your bumper, your hands will get jumpy, the car will
    swerve, and you'll make constant, small mistakes. Focusing
    further down the road (not ten miles ahead), but far enough to
    sense the curve, smooths out the motion. It doesn't guarantee
    safety, but it makes the journey steady.  Focus too far ahead
    and you'll miss potholes or a person running across the road
    or some other unexpected obstacle.
</p>

<p>
    All this to say.. there isn't a "right" answer here. I think the
    "choice" between planning and presence is one of many
    tug-of-wars that shape our experience. It's not about solving
    it; it's about noticing the tension.
</p>

<h4>The Windows We Usually Miss</h4>

<p>
    This duality hit me hard as I kept swimming, moving through the
    water as this idea was expanding in my mind.  I never try to
    orchestrate the workout.  I just let myself flow. The thought
    that came to me completely changed the texture of the experience
    that I was already having.
</p>

<p>I started noticing the glimpses.</p>

<p>
    We usually talk about life in chapters (or seasons).. college..
    marriage.. the new job.. the move.. retirement.. But life doesn't
    actually happen in chapters. It happens in micro-seconds. It
    happens in flashes that are so intense and fleeting that if you
    blink, or if you're too busy looking at the "tenth rock," you miss
    them entirely (only to realize it later in life; what was right
    there all along).
</p>

<p>
    I experienced these micro-seconds profoundly during my
    SpiritualTech road trip. The mountains of New Mexico and the
    stark deserts of Texas and Utah offered a silence that forced
    introspection; the kind of space where your mind stops rushing
    and just *sees*. Contrast that with the humid, overwhelming green
    of Kentucky, or the eerie stillness of various deserted towns
    scattered across the nation. I saw these glimpses in the ceremonial
    air of capitol buildings, in the unique downtown architecture,
    in hikes to remote areas, and in the quiet, enduring life of small
    towns and Native American tribal lands. <b>It's the difference
    between planning the map and realizing the map is actually drawn
    by these unexpected moments.</b>
</p>

<p>
    I'm talking about the way the light refracted through the water
    for a split second, creating a pattern in the pool water that
    looked surreal. Or the sensation of the air hitting your lungs
    after a long underwater glide.  Super fleeting experiences in
    the way the world exists in this moment and only in that moment.
</p>

<blockquote>
    These moments aren't just filler scenes between the big events.
    They are the events. They are the windows into the deeper life
    we're usually too distracted to recognize.  They create the life
    we spend our whole lives trying to understand.
</blockquote>

<p>
    It's strange, isn't it? We spend so much energy trying to
    stabilize the ground beneath us, trying to predict the future,
    that we forget that the magic is usually happening in the
    unstable, unscripted air between the steps.
</p>

<p>
    We're so focused on the destination that we miss the view from
    the journey. I don't have the balance figured out yet. I still
    catch myself trying to map all of the rocks aheads of me. But
    tonight, at least, I'm letting myself just be in the moment
    and appreciate the water while I'm in it.
</p>

<p>
    How about you? When was the last time you felt yourself pause
    and really see one of those glimpses?
