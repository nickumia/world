    I've been thinking about the idea of "the 1%," and I don't really
    like it because it's one of those phrases that's loaded before you
    even touch it. Most people hear it and immediately picture the same
    thing: ultra-wealthy people, excess, some vague moral failure
    wrapped in money.
</p>

<p>
    But that version of the 1% feels... incomplete.
</p>

<p>
    There are so many other 1%s that don't get as much attention. The
    percentage of people who run a marathon. Or who reach a certain
    depth underwater. Or who learn how to fly a plane. Or who leave the
    planet entirely. Even things that sound almost boring on paper, like
    the number of people who manage to retire in their early forties.
    It's not like the 'money 1%' that pervades most of life.  When I read
    that statistic recently about the early retirees and saw it was
    less than 1%, I paused for a real minute. Not because it felt
    impressive, but because I'd never framed it that way before.
</p>

<p>
    It made me wonder how many of the things we chase aren't really
    chosen.. We just learn about them and seek to replicate the
    "success" we see.
</p>

<p>
    I've been pursuing financial independence for a long time now, more
    intentionally in the last few years. I'm just about wrapping up my
    late twenties, and depending on how things unfold, I could reach it
    in as little as three more years, or maybe closer to eight. There's
    a bit of quiet disbelief ... It's not like I've solved some magic
    growth formula. There is nothing guaranteed about my financial
    future.  But it's definitely very surreal to watch the last six
    months produce the same amount what once took me FIVE years
    to accrue.
</p>

<p>
    And something's been bothering me... not the goal itself, but the
    way goals get handed down to us. No one really taught me what I know
    about finance.. There were soo many experiences that got me to that
    point.  If I had followed any individual experience, I would be in
    a very different place... We're taught what "winning" looks like long
    before we understand ourselves well enough to decide whether that
    version of winning even fits. Somewhere along the way,
    copying someone else's path becomes easier than sitting with the
    discomfort of asking what we actually want.
</p>

<p>
    There's nothing wrong with copying. It's how humans learn. But
    copying only works if the person you're copying resonates with you
    on a deeper level.  It's not just in the outcome, but in the
    lifestyle, tradeoffs, and values. Otherwise, you end up chasing a
    life that looks right from the outside and feels alien from the
    inside.
</p>

<p>
    Potential doesn't show up the same way for everyone because people
    have different natural orientations. Certain directions feel
    stabilizing; others feel destabilizing even when things are "going
    well." Progress in the wrong direction still moves you forward,
    just away from yourself. Some paths return energy as you move through
    them. Others only take.
</p>
<p>
    When success is defined in a way that continually drains you...
</p>
<p>
    When you are forced into the wrong version of "success"...
</p>
<p>
    Discipline stops producing growth and starts breaking connection.
</p>

<p>
    I don't have a clean takeaway here. I'm still in the middle of it.
    But the question that keeps coming back is simple, and
    uncomfortable, and probably worth sitting with longer than we
    usually do:
</p>

<blockquote>
    What 1% are you actually trying to belong to?
</blockquote>

<p>
    Not the one that sounds impressive.
    Not the one you inherited.
    The one that would still matter if no one was watching.
</p>

<p>
    It's a very personal question.  But the answer is very real.  If you
    are able to answer it, people who truly know you will be able to see
    you live the answer.  I think asking the question might be the
    beginning of something more honest.
