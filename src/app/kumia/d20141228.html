<p>Zindagi kitni special hoon.  It's generous enough to give us this journey that for
us has no real reason other than what we think that reason is.  I'm not sure if what I'm
experiencing now is my life or if the prologue is still <s>building up</s> mounting.  
However, what I do know is that <s>what s</s> kya shuru August 9th main was rishta,
<s>woh</s> it has given me a lot to be grateful for.  By the time you read this, I have
no clue what life will be like.  I hope you have found that special being with whom there
is complete understanding.  <s>You and I both know what I felt about you</s> Sāyada I'll
find out <s>when</s> by the time you read this.  Ya sāyada nahi haha.  As people grow
older, they form an image of either who they want to be, what they want to do, or kuch aur.
I'm not sure if people <s>just don't</s> stopped <s>trying to strive</s> striving toward
their dreams or people strive but, very few people, actually reach where they wanted to.
Lekin, <s>maybe</s> agara tu yaada karo, I never wanted to be one of those people...</p>

<p>Originally, yeh kitabe was going to hold kuch gaharā raaz mere zindagi se.  Aur yeh
saccí hai.  However, it is more to accomplish my second dream, which coincidentally
<s>is your first dream</s> tumhara pehla sapna hai.  Ab, reading this far, I must say
that I'm glad you haven't torn apart or set this book to flames.  If I accomplish
what I need to , then that will happen, .. but not yet haha</p>

<p>If I'm lucky, I will be able to knock off two dreams with a single act.  Leaving a
legacy has always been a goal of mine and it is likely, it  won't be complete until I die
which is fine by me becaues anything good never comes easy with the right path.  The
last thing I want from this book is misunderstanding there has been enough of that all my
life.  I have had to hide and hold back so much just so that life could move smoothly for
the people I know <s>and love</s> most of whom I love.  Can you imagine the pain felt when
a son can't talk openly with his mother for fear of his dad getting vex?</p>
