    The contained in this post is a root of many ideas that have
    sprung knowledge about my own behavior, and the behavior of
    the world I'm attempting to understand (and hopefully
    influence in a positive way).  It came to me when a friend and
    I foolishly attempted to bookclub a 1000-page book, titled
    "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst".

<blockquote>
    Why did scientists choose to say that neurons get "excited"
    vs. are just active?
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>Excited: elated electrical pulse/charge where a neuron can
        be "ready-to-fire" / "close to firing"</li>
    <li>Active: Action is already occurring</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Excited is more like potential energy vs. Active being more like
    kinetic energy.
</p>

<blockquote>
    Why is the distinction important? Can a neuron be excited and
    not fire?
</blockquote>
<p>
    Yes, excitation is variable/gradient-ed (not binary). Within each
    neuron, there is a different threshold level where it actually
    becomes active.
</p>
<p>
    Side notes:
    <ul>
        <li>Epileptic seizures are an example of too much excitation
            (i.e. runaway activity)</li>
        <li>Sedatives/anesthetics enhance inhibition, so neurons may
            be excited, but unable to cross the active threshold</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<blockquote>
    Can someone override inhibition by just saying yes all the time?
</blockquote>
<p>
    Neural inhibition isn't something that can be ignored; if enough
    inhibitory current is flowing, the neuron cannot fire.
</p>
<pre>
    active = excitation current + inhibition current
</pre>
<p>
    Psychological/Behavioral inhibition is different. You can't just "will" your neurons to ignore inhibition. In behavior though, you can choose patterns that look like overriding inhibition.
</p>

<blockquote>
    So... choosing to say yes can override inhibition?
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>Inhibition isn't just a suggestion; it's an electrical clamp on activity</li>
    <li>Humans can act against their inhibitory signals (i.e. feel doubt/fear/hesitation but still say yes)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    Does neural inhibition get retrained by saying yes?
</blockquote>
<p>
    Essentially, yes. The brain can adjust balance between
    excitation and inhibition through synaptic plasticity to
    strengthen or weaken synapses based on repeated patterns
    (e.g. exposure therapy retrains fear circuits and inhibitory
    responses (fear/avoidance) weaken if you repeatedly act
    ("say yes") in safe contexts)
</p>
<p>
    Behaviorally, if you always act with a yes (despite inhibition
    like doubt, fear, hesitation), you are essentially retraining
    your response patterns. Over time, the brain learns that
    inhibition isn't necessary in those contexts.
</p>

<blockquote>
    Is inhibition always about "stopping"?
</blockquote>
<p>
    Neurally, inhibition prevents a neuron from firing. Inhibition
    often doesn't just stop; it sculpts when and how neurons fire,
    e.g.
    <ul>
        <li>Sharpen signals → suppress background noise so important
            signals stand out.</li>
        <li>Refine timing → making sure spikes only happen at the
            right moment.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<blockquote>
    So.. is inhibition a part of choice?
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>Excitation pushes toward action (say/do something).</li>
    <li>Inhibition holds back or refines that action.</li>
    <li>Choice emerges from the balance: which signals win out at
        the moment.</li>
    <li>Without inhibition, you'd act on every impulse instantly;
        no filtering, no pause to weigh options.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    Is neural inhibition and social inhibition the same?
</blockquote>
<p>
    Not really... they are different tools that affect the ultimate
    decision/behavior.
</p>

<blockquote>
    Is behavioral inhibition the root of regret when you decide
    not to do something your brain tells you to do?
</blockquote>
<p>
    Behavioral inhibition is the system that pauses or prevents
    actions when there's risk, uncertainty, or conflict. Then your
    higher level cognition makes a decision based on this "data."
</p>
<p>
    If behavioral inhibition stops you from acting (e.g., not
    speaking up, not trying something risky), and later you think
    the outcome would have been good, that gap can trigger regret.
</p>

<blockquote>
    So how does choosing not to feel regret relate to there being
    a gap in what the brain wanted to do?
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>Your brain generates impulses, desires, or urges ("I want to
        do X").</li>
    <li>Behavioral inhibition can stop you from acting on them ("don't
        do X").</li>
    <li>This creates a gap: the action your brain was ready to execute
        vs. what you actually did.</li>
    <li>That gap is what regret feeds on: your mind evaluates: "I
        wanted to act, but I didn't; maybe I missed out."</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Choosing not to feel regret
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can consciously frame the inaction differently:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"I chose not to act for a good reason."</li>
        <li>"The outcome isn't worth regretting."</li>
    </ul>
    <li>By reinterpreting the gap, you reduce the emotional
        impact of it.</li>
    <li>This doesn't erase the neural signals of the gap. The
        desire still existed, but it reshapes the evaluation, so
        regret doesn't arise.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <i>So choosing not to feel regret is not about eliminating the
    gap, it's about controlling the brain's response to the gap.</i>
